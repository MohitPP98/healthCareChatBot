# healthCareChatBot
Java program for a healthcare chatbot that uses an API:
In this example, the chatbot uses the Infermedica API to diagnose a medical condition based on a user's symptoms. 
The chatbot prompts the user to enter a symptom, and then makes a GET request to the API to retrieve the diagnosis. 
The response from the API is in JSON format, so you would need to parse the JSON to extract the diagnosis.
